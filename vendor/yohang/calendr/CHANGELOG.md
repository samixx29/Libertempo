CHANGELOG
=========

2.0.0
-----

 * Non-strict mode does not exists anymore (use the factory / calendar to create periods)
 * No more google calendar provider (hard to maintain and a bit out of the scope of this library)
 * Removed first-monday / last-sunday in favor of first weekday / last weekday
 * Factory argument is now mandatory for period instantiation
